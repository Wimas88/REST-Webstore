# REST-Webstore
Showcase of a RESTful online store that simulates the business logic of an order

Features: Java EE7, JPA, EJB 3.2, JTA, ORM, REST and design patterns.

This project is a demonstration of the business logic for an online web-store.
It contains only a part of the original project, focusing only on the core functionality of a processing order.
I have purposely detatched every other aspect from the original one, it is mostly a showcase of my competence in regard to the Java Enterprise core.
It is NOT intended to be integrated in a full project, as it lacks all the functionality and the documentation from the original, even though every method is practical by itself.
